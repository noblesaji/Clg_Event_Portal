# The Eventus Portal
The Eventus Portal intends to reform the conventional way of handling events held in a community and to optimize the hassle of registrations.
This portal is able to (but not limited to) do the following:
- Students can create user accounts
- Explore and register for upcoming events
- Create events held in the community or campus
- View the number of participants registered for each event
